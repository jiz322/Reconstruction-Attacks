# Reconstruction-Attacks

## Dataset Used
[olivetti_faces](https://www.kaggle.com/code/serkanpeldek/face-recognition-on-olivetti-dataset)

## Motivation
A well-trained machine learning model contains information of training data. If this model is disclosed to malicous users, they can retrieve these information which results in privacy leakage. By attacking a very simple face-recognizion model, we aim for a better understanding of this "Reconstruction Attack." 

## Methods

* Generative adversarial network (GAN)

* Diffusion model fine-tuning (ongoing)

## Result Using GAN
Images in the Training Set             |  Reconstructed Result
